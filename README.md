# TundraTN ‚ùÑ

A package of useful services for webMethods Trading Networks 7.1 and higher.

## Related

See also [Tundra](https://github.com/Permafrost/Tundra), a package of useful services for webMethods Integration Server 7.1 and higher.

## Dependencies

TundraTN is dependent on the following packages:

* Tundra - https://github.com/Permafrost/Tundra.git
* WmTN

## Installation

You have two choices for installing TundraTN: git or zip. If you are comfortable using git,
I recommend this method as you can then easily switch between package versions using git
checkout and download new versions using git fetch.

### Using Git

To install with this method, first make sure that:
* Git is [installed](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your Integration Server
* Your Integration Server has internet access to https://github.com (for cloning the repository)
* The dependent packages listed above are installed and enabled on your Integration Server

From your Integration Server installation:

```sh
$ cd ./packages/
$ git clone https://github.com/Permafrost/TundraTN.git
$ cd ./TundraTN/
$ git checkout v<n.n.n> # where <n.n.n> is the desired version
```

Then activate and enable the TundraTN package from the package management web page on your Integration Server
web administration site.

### Using Zip

1. Download a zip of the desired version of the package from https://github.com/Permafrost/TundraTN/releases
2. Copy the TundraTN-vn.n.n.zip file to your Integration Server's ./replicate/inbound/ directory
3. Install and activate the TundraTN package release (TundraTN-vn.n.n.zip) from the package management web page
on your Integration Server's web administration site

## Upgrading

When upgrading you have to choose the same method used to originally install the package. Unfortunately, if git
wasn't used to install the package then you can't use git to upgrade it either. However, if you want to switch
to using git to manage the package, delete the installed package and start over using the git method for
installation.

### Using Git

To upgrade with this method, first make sure that:
* Git is [installed](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your Integration Server
* Your Integration Server has internet access to https://github.com (for fetching updates from the repository)
* The dependent packages listed above are installed and enabled on your Integration Server
* You originally installed TundraTN using the git method described above

From your Integration Server installation:

```sh
$ cd ./packages/TundraTN/
$ git fetch
$ git checkout v<n.n.n> # where <n.n.n> is the desired updated version
```

Then reload the TundraTN package from the package management web page on your Integration Server web administration
site.

### Using Zip

1. Download a zip of the desired updated version of the package from https://github.com/Permafrost/TundraTN/releases
2. Copy the TundraTN-vn.n.n.zip file to your Integration Server's ./replicate/inbound/ directory
3. Install and activate the updated TundraTN package release (TundraTN-vn.n.n.zip) from the package management web page
on your Integration Server's web administration site

## Conventions

1. All input and output pipeline arguments are prefixed with '$' as a poor-man's
   scoping mechanism (typical user-space variables will be unprefixed), except
   Trading Networks-specific arguments, such as bizdoc, sender and receiver
2. All boolean arguments are suffixed with a '?'
3. Single-word argument names are preferred. Where multiple words are necessary,
   words are separated with a '.'
4. Service namespace is kept flat. Namespace folders are usually nouns. Service
   names are usually verbs, indicating the action performed on the noun (parent
   folder)
5. All private elements are kept in the tundra.tn.support folder. All other
   elements comprise the public API of the package. As the private
   elements do not contribute to the public API, they are liable to change at
   any time. Enter at your own risk

## Services

Top-level services for the most common tasks:

* #### tundra.tn:amend

  Edits the given XML or flat file bizdoc content part with the list of {key,
  value} pairs specified in `$amendments`.

  The keys in `$amendments` can be fully-qualified, for example `a/b/c[0]`, and
  the values can include percent-delimited variable substitution strings which
  will be substituted prior to being inserted in `$document`.

  The bizdoc user status is first updated to 'AMENDING', then the content part
  identified by `$part.input` (or the default content part if not specified) is
  parsed to an IData document using the named $schema (or the schema
  configured on the TN document type if not specified), the amendments are
  applied via the `$amendments` {key, value} pairs, the amended IData document
  is then emitted as stream then added to the bizdoc as a new content part
  identified by `$part.output` (or 'amendment' if not specified), and the bizdoc
  user status is updated to 'AMENDED'.

  This service is designed to be used in conjunction with other TN processing
  rule actions, such as the 'Deliver document by' action, which can use the
  amended content part for delivery rather than the original content part.

  Supports 'strict' mode processing of bizdocs: if any `$strict` error classes
  are set to 'true' and the bizdoc contains errors for any of these classes,
  the bizdoc will not be processed; instead an exception will be thrown and
  handled by the `$catch` service. For example, if you have enabled duplicate
  document checking on the Trading Networks document type and do not wish to
  process duplicates, set the `$strict/Saving` error class to 'true' and
  duplicate documents will not be processed and will instead have their user
  status set to 'ABORTED' (when using the standard `$catch` service).

  This service is designed to be called directly from a Trading Networks
  bizdoc processing rule.

* #### tundra.tn:branch

  Evaluates each given branch condition in the specified order against the
  pipeline and executes the action for the first matching branch against the
  bizdoc being processed.

  Conditions can be any statement supported by
  `Tundra/tundra.condition:evaluate`. The condition will be evaluated against a
  pipeline containing `$bizdoc`, `$sender`, `$receiver`, the parsed bizdoc content
  as an IData document called `$document`, and the parsing schema/document
  blueprint used by the parser as a string called `$schema`.

  A null condition will always evaluate to true, and can therefore be used as
  a default branch statement to match any documents unmatched by more specific
  conditions.

  Supported actions include all the relevant TundraTN top-level processing
  services:
  * `TundraTN/tundra.tn:chain`
  * `TundraTN/tundra.tn:deliver`
  * `TundraTN/tundra.tn:derive`
  * `TundraTN/tundra.tn:enqueue`
  * `TundraTN/tundra.tn:process`
  * `TundraTN/tundra.tn:split`
  * `TundraTN/tundra.tn:translate`

  This service is designed to be called directly from a Trading Networks
  bizdoc processing rule.

* #### tundra.tn:chain

  Processes a Trading Networks document sequentially via the given list of
  processing services.

  As this service provides logging, content parsing, error handling, and
  bizdoc status updates, the processing services do not need to include any of
  this common boilerplate code.

  Supports 'strict' mode processing of bizdocs: if any `$strict` error classes
  are set to 'true' and the bizdoc contains errors for any of these classes,
  the bizdoc will not be processed; instead an exception will be thrown and
  handled by the `$catch` service. For example, if you have enabled duplicate
  document checking on the Trading Networks document type and do not wish to
  process duplicates, set the `$strict/Saving` error class to 'true' and
  duplicate documents will not be processed and will instead have their user
  status set to 'ABORTED' (when using the standard `$catch` service).

  This service is designed to be called directly from a Trading Networks
  bizdoc processing rule.

  * Inputs:
    * `bizdoc` is the Trading Networks document to be processed.

    * `$services` is a list of fully-qualified service names to be called
      sequentially to process the bizdoc. Refer to the
      `TundraTN/tundra.tn.schema:processor` specification as a guide to the
      inputs and outputs required of the processing service.

    * `$catch` is an optional fully-qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked if an exception is thrown while attempting to
      process the bizdoc. The input pipeline will include the following
      variables, as per a normal catch service invoked by
      `Tundra/tundra.service:ensure`: `$exception`, `$exception?`, `$exception.class`,
      `$exception.message`, and `$exception.stack`. If not specified, defaults to
      `TundraTN/tundra.tn.exception:handle`, the standard TundraTN exception
      handler.

    * `$finally` is an optional fully-qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked after processing, and whether or not an
      exception is encountered during processing.

    * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document containing additional arbitrary
      input arguments for `$service` (or `WmPublic/pub.flatFile:convertToValues`,
      `WmPublic/pub.xml:xmlStringToXMLNode`, or `WmPublic/pub.xml:xmlNodeToDocument`
      via `Tundra/tundra.tn.document:parse`). Fully-qualified names will be
      handled correctly, for example an argument named `example/item[0]` will
      be converted to an IData document named `example` containing a String
      list named `item` with it's first value set accordingly.

    * `$service.input` is an optional name to be used when adding the parsed
      bizdoc content to the input pipeline of the call to `$service`. Defaults
      to `$document`. Not used if `$parse?` is false.

    * `$status.done` is an optional user status to use for the bizdoc when
      processing has completed successfully. Defaults to DONE.

    * `$parse?` is an optional boolean flag indicating whether the specified
      bizdoc content part should be parsed to an IData document and added to
      the input pipeline of the call to `$service`. Defaults to true.

    * `$prefix?` is an optional boolean flag indicating whether to use the '$'
      prefix on the standard input arguments (`bizdoc`, `sender`, and `receiver`)
      when calling `$service`. When true `$service` should implement the
      `TundraTN/tundra.tn.schema:processor` specification, when false `$service`
      should implement the `WmTN/wm.tn.rec:ProcessingService` specification.
      Defaults to true.

    * `$part` is an optional name identifying the bizdoc content part to be
      parsed and added to the input pipeline of the call to `$service`. Defaults
      to the default content part (xmldata for XML documents, ffdata for Flat
      File documents). Not used if `$parse?` is false.

    * `$encoding` optional character encoding to be used when reading the bizdoc
      content part bytes. If not specified, defaults to the character set
      specified in the MIME content type of the content part being parsed, or
      failing that the Java virtual machine [default charset].

    * `$strict` is an optional set of boolean flags which when true abort the
      processing of the bizdoc when it contains any errors with the associated
      class.
      * `Recognition`
      * `Verification`
      * `Validation`
      * `Persistence`
      * `Saving`
      * `Routing`

* #### tundra.tn:deliver

  Delivers Trading Networks document (bizdoc) content to the given destination
  URI.

  Variable substitution is performed on all variables specified in the
  `$pipeline` document, and the `$destination` URI, allowing for dynamic
  generation of any of these values. Also, if `$service` is specified, it will
  be called prior to variable substitution and thus can be used to populate
  the pipeline with variables to be used by the substitution.

  This service leverages the service `Tundra/tundra.content:deliver`. Therefore,
  additional delivery protocols can be implemented by creating a service named
  for the URI scheme in the folder `tundra.content.deliver`.  Services in this
  folder should implement the `tundra.schema.content.deliver:handler`
  specification.

  This service is designed to be called directly from a Trading Networks
  bizdoc processing rule.

  * Inputs:
    * `bizdoc` is the Trading Networks document whose content is to be delivered.

    * `$destination` is either a URI, or a named destination (such as Receiver's
      Preferred Protocol), to which the bizdoc content will be delivered.
      Supports the following delivery protocols (URI schemes):
      * `file`: writes the given content to the file specified by the
        destination URI. The following additional options can be provided via
        the `$pipeline` document:
        * `$mode`: append / write

      * `http`: transmits the given content to the destination URI. The
        following additional options can be provided via the `$pipeline` document:
        * `$method`: get / put / post / delete / head / trace / options
        * `$headers/*`: additional HTTP headers as required
        * `$authority/user`: the username to log on to the remote web server
        * `$authority/password`: the password to log on to the remote web server

      * `https`: refer to http

      * `mailto`: sends an email with the given content attached. An example
        mailto URI is as follows:

            mailto:bob@example.com?cc=jane@example.com&subject=Example&body=Example&attachment=message.xml

        The following additional override options can be provided via the
        `$pipeline` document:
        * `$attachment`: the attached file's name
        * `$from`: email address to send the email from
        * `$subject`: the subject line text
        * `$body`: the main text of the email
        * `$smtp`: an SMTP URI specifying the SMTP server to use (for example,
          `smtp://user:password@host:port`), defaults to the SMTP server
          configured in the Integration Server setting `watt.server.smtpServer`

    * `$service` is an optional fully-qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked prior to delivery, thus allowing a service to
      perform processing to influence the delivery (such as populating the
      pipeline with configuration variables at runtime).

    * `$catch` is an optional fully-qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked if an exception is thrown while attempting
      delivery. The input pipeline will include the variables described in
      the specification `Tundra/tundra.schema.exception:handler`, as per a
      normal catch service invoked by `Tundra/tundra.service:ensure`. Defaults
      to `TundraTN/tundra.tn.exception:handle`, the standard TundraTN exception
      handler, when not specified.

    * `$finally` is an optional fully-qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked after delivery, and whether or not an
      exception is encountered during delivery.

    * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document containing arbitrary variables
      which can be used to influence the delivery. See the `$destination`
      description above for transport-specific options which can be provided
      via this IData document.

    * `$status.done` is an optional user status to use for the bizdoc when
      delivery has completed successfully. Defaults to DONE.

    * `$part` is an optional name of the bizdoc content part to be delivered.
      Defaults to the default content part when not specified (xmldata for XML
      document types, ffdata for Flat File document types).

    * `$parse?` is an optional boolean flag which when true parses the bizdoc
      content part identified by `$part` using the parsing schema configured on
      the Trading Networks document type, prior to both invoking `$service`, if
      specified, and content delivery. The parsed document content can then be
      used in conjunction with variable substitution for influencing the
      delivery URI based on the content of the document. Defaults to false.

    * `$prefix?` is an optional boolean flag indicating whether to use the '$'
      prefix on the standard input arguments (bizdoc, sender, and receiver)
      when calling `$service`. When true `$service` should implement the
      `TundraTN/tundra.tn.schema:processor` specification; when false `$service`
      should implement the `WmTN/wm.tn.rec:ProcessingService` specification.
      Defaults to true.

    * `$encoding` is an optional character set to use when to encode text
      content for delivery. Defaults to the Java virtual machine
      [default charset].

    * `$strict` is an optional set of boolean flags that control 'strict' mode
      processing of bizdocs: if any error classes are set to 'true' and the
      bizdoc contains errors for those classes, the bizdoc will not be
      processed; instead an exception will be thrown and handled by the
      $catch service.

      For example, if you have enabled duplicate document checking on the
      Trading Networks document type and do not wish to deliver duplicates,
      set the `$strict/Saving` error class to 'true' and duplicate documents
      will not be delivered, and will instead have their user status set to
      'ABORTED' (when using the standard `$catch` service).

      The following flags are supported, and all default to true if not
      specified:

      * `Recognition`
      * `Verification`
      * `Validation`
      * `Persistence`
      * `Saving`
      * `Routing`

* #### tundra.tn:derive

  Derives new bizdocs from an existing bizdoc, updating the sender and/or
  receiver on each derivative.

  Supports 'strict' mode processing of bizdocs: if any `$strict` error classes
  are set to 'true' and the bizdoc contains errors for any of these classes,
  the bizdoc will not be processed; instead an exception will be thrown and
  handled by the `$catch` service. For example, if you have enabled duplicate
  document checking on the Trading Networks document type and do not wish to
  process duplicates, set the `$strict/Saving` error class to 'true' and
  duplicate documents will not be processed and will instead have their user
  status set to 'ABORTED' (when using the standard `$catch` service).

  Upon successful processing by this service, the bizdoc user status will be
  either set to `$status.done` if one or more derivatives were created, or
  `$status.ignored` if no derivatives are created, unless the `$service`
  processing service has already changed the user status, in which case this
  service will not change it again.

  This service is designed to be called directly from a Trading Networks
  bizdoc processing rule.

  * Inputs:
    * `bizdoc` is the Trading Networks document from which bizdoc copies will be
      derived.

    * `$service` is an optional fully qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked prior to deriving any bizdoc copies, thus
      allowing a service to perform processing to influence the derivative
      process (such as specifying additional derivative rules at runtime). The
      service is invoked with an input pipeline containing the following
      variables: `$bizdoc`, `$sender`, `$receiver`, `$document` (the parsed bizdoc
      default content part), `$schema`, `$schema.type`, and `$derivatives`. If any
      derivative rules are added, changed, or removed, the service must return
      the `$derivatives` rule list in its output pipeline.

    * `$catch` is an optional fully qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked if an exception is thrown while attempting to
      derive bizdoc copies. The input pipeline will include the following
      variables, as per a normal catch service invoked by
      `Tundra/tundra.service:ensure`: `$exception`, `$exception?`, `$exception.class`,
      `$exception.message` and `$exception.stack`. If not specified, defaults to
      `TundraTN/tundra.tn.exception:handle`, the standard TundraTN exception
      handler.

    * `$finally` is an optional fully qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked after processing, and whether or not an
      exception is encountered during processing.

    * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document containing arbitrary variables
      which can be used to influence the derivative process.

    * `$derivatives` is a list of rules describing when and what copies are to
      be made of this bizdoc:
      * `description` is an optional description of the derivative rule, used in
        all related activity log statements.
      * `sender` is an optional (internal or external) ID identifying the
        desired Trading Networks partner profile to be used as the sender on
        the derivative bizdoc. Defaults to the original bizdoc sender if not
        specified.
      * `receiver` is an optional (internal or external) ID identifying the
        desired Trading Networks partner profile to be used as the receiver on
        the derivative bizdoc. Defaults to the original bizdoc receiver if not
        specified.
      * `type` is an optional Trading Networks external ID type used to
        interpret the above `sender` and `receiver` values. If not specified, then
        the sender and receiver IDs are treated as internal partner profile
        IDs.
      * `filter` is an optional inline filter condition (as supported by
        `Tundra/tundra.condition:evaluate`) or fully qualified service name of a
        service implementing the `TundraTN/tundra.tn.schema.derivative:filter`
        specification. If specifying an inline filter condition, the input
        pipeline will be the same as described for a filter service by the
        `TundraTN/tundra.tn.schema.derivative:filter` specification. If not
        specified, then a copy will always be derived for this new sender/
        receiver.
      * `amendments` is an optional list of {key, value} pairs used to make
        small inline modifications to the derived bizdoc content:
        * `key` is a fully-qualified reference to a field in the parsed bizdoc
          content.
        * `value` is the new value to be assigned to the element associated with
          the given key.
        * `condition` is an optional `Tundra/tundra.condition:evaluate`
          conditional statement can also be specified, which is evaluated
          against the pipeline containing `$bizdoc`, `$sender`, `$receiver`, and
          `$document` (the parsed bizdoc content), and only if the condition
          evaluates to true will the associated amended value be applied. If
          not specified, the amended value will always be applied.
      * `attributes` is an optional list of {key, value} pairs used to set
        attributes on the derived bizdoc:
        * `key` identifies the attribute that is set to the given `value`.
        * `value` is the new value to be assigned to the attribute associated
          with the given `key`.
        * `condition` is an optional `Tundra/tundra.condition:evaluate`
          conditional statement can also be specified, which is evaluated
          against the pipeline containing `$bizdoc`, `$sender`, `$receiver`, and
          `$document` (the parsed bizdoc content), and only if the condition
          evaluates to true will the attribute be added to the derived bizdoc.
          If not specified, the attribute will always be added to the derived
          bizdoc.
      * `TN_parms` is an optional IData document containing routing hints used
        when routing the derivative bizdoc.
      * `enabled?` is an optional boolean flag, when true this derivative rule
        is active, when false, this derivative rule is inactive and ignored.
        Defaults to true when not specified.

    * `$status.done` is an optional user status to use for the bizdoc when
      derivatives have been created successfully. Defaults to DONE.

    * `$status.ignored` is an optional user status to use for the bizdoc when no
      derivatives are created due to filtering. Defaults to IGNORED.

    * `$prefix?` is an optional boolean flag indicating whether to use the '$'
      prefix on the standard input arguments (bizdoc, sender, and receiver)
      when calling `$service`. When true `$service` should implement the
      `TundraTN/tundra.tn.schema:processor` specification, when false `$service`
      should implement the `WmTN/wm.tn.rec:ProcessingService` specification.
      Defaults to true.

    * `$part` is the optional name of the bizdoc content part to be copied to
      the resulting derivatives. Defaults to the default content part when not
      specified (xmldata for XML document types, ffdata for Flat File document
      types).

    * `$strict` is an optional set of boolean flags which when true abort the
      processing of the bizdoc when it contains any errors with the associated
      class.
      * `Recognition`
      * `Verification`
      * `Validation`
      * `Persistence`
      * `Saving`
      * `Routing`

* #### tundra.tn:discard

  Receives arbitrary (XML or flat file) content and then discards it
  (does nothing with it). This is the Trading Networks equivalent of
  Unix's [/dev/null], which is useful for successfully receiving
  messages from a partner that do not need to be saved or processed.

  This service is intended to be invoked by clients via HTTP or FTP.

* #### tundra.tn:enqueue

  Enqueues a Trading Networks document to the given queue for deferred
  processing by that queue.

  Supports 'strict' mode processing of bizdocs: if any `$strict` error classes
  are set to 'true' and the bizdoc contains errors for any of these classes,
  the bizdoc will not be processed; instead an exception will be thrown and
  handled by the `$catch` service. For example, if you have enabled duplicate
  document checking on the Trading Networks document type and do not wish to
  process duplicates, set the `$strict/Saving` error class to 'true' and
  duplicate documents will not be processed and will instead have their user
  status set to 'ABORTED' (when using the standard `$catch` service).

  This service is designed to be called directly from a Trading Networks
  bizdoc processing rule.

  * Inputs:
    * bizdoc is the Trading Networks document to be enqueued.

    * `$queue` is either the name of the Trading Networks public queue
      the document should be enqueued to, or the value "Receiver's Queue"
      in which case the document will be enqueued to the delivery queue
      associated with the receiver partner profile.

    * `$catch` is an optional fully-qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked if an exception is thrown while attempting to
      process the bizdoc. The input pipeline will include the following
      variables, as per a normal catch service invoked by
      `Tundra/tundra.service:ensure`: `$exception`, `$exception?`, `$exception.class`,
      `$exception.message`, and `$exception.stack`. If not specified, defaults to
      `TundraTN/tundra.tn.exception:handle`, the standard TundraTN exception
      handler.

    * `$finally` is an optional fully-qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked after processing, and whether or not an
      exception is encountered during processing.

    * `$strict` is an optional set of boolean flags which when true abort the
      processing of the bizdoc when it contains any errors with the associated
      class.
      * `Recognition`
      * `Verification`
      * `Validation`
      * `Persistence`
      * `Saving`
      * `Routing`

* #### tundra.tn:log

  Logs a message in the Trading Networks activity log, prefixed with the host
  name on which the log was created for better diagnostics.

  * Inputs:
    * `$bizdoc` is an optional Trading Networks document against which to log the
      message.

    * `$type` is an optional choice of MESSAGE, WARNING, or ERROR, which
      describes the type of message being logged. Defaults to MESSAGE.

    * `$class` is an optional message class or category.

    * `$summary` is an optional short title or summary of the message being
      logged. If not specified, defaults to be the same as `$message`.

    * `$message` is an optional message to be logged. If not specified, defaults
      to an empty string.

* #### tundra.tn:process

  Processes a Trading Networks document via the given `$service` processing
  service.

  As this service provides logging, content parsing, error handling, and
  bizdoc status updates, the `$service` processing service does not need to
  include any of this common boilerplate code.

  Supports 'strict' mode processing of bizdocs: if any `$strict` error classes
  are set to 'true' and the bizdoc contains errors for any of these classes,
  the bizdoc will not be processed; instead an exception will be thrown and
  handled by the `$catch` service. For example, if you have enabled duplicate
  document checking on the Trading Networks document type and do not wish to
  process duplicates, set the `$strict/Saving` error class to 'true' and
  duplicate documents will not be processed and will instead have their user
  status set to 'ABORTED' (when using the standard `$catch` service).

  This service is designed to be called directly from a Trading Networks
  bizdoc processing rule.

  * Inputs:
    * `bizdoc` is the Trading Networks document to be processed.

    * `$service` is the fully-qualified service name to be called to process the
      bizdoc. Refer to the `TundraTN/tundra.tn.schema:processor` specification
      as a guide to the inputs and outputs required of the processing service.

    * `$catch` is an optional fully-qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked if an exception is thrown while attempting to
      process the bizdoc. The input pipeline will include the following
      variables, as per a normal catch service invoked by
      `Tundra/tundra.service:ensure`: `$exception`, `$exception?`, `$exception.class`,
      `$exception.message`, and `$exception.stack`. If not specified, defaults to
      `TundraTN/tundra.tn.exception:handle`, the standard TundraTN exception
      handler.

    * `$finally` is an optional fully-qualified service name which, when
      specified, will be invoked after processing, and whether or not an
      exception is encountered during processing.

    * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document containing additional arbitrary
      input arguments for `$service` (or `WmPublic/pub.flatFile:convertToValues`,
      `WmPublic/pub.xml:xmlStringToXMLNode`, or `WmPublic/pub.xml:xmlNodeToDocument` via
      `Tundra/tundra.tn.document:parse`). Fully-qualified names will be handled
      correctly, for example an argument named `example/item[0]` will be
      converted to an IData document named `example` containing a String list
      named `item` with it's first value set accordingly.

    * `$service.input` is an optional name to be used when adding the parsed
      bizdoc content to the input pipeline of the call to `$service`. Defaults
      to $document. Not used if `$parse?` is false.

      the input pipeline of the call to `$service`. Defaults to true.

    * `$prefix?` is an optional boolean flag indicating whether to use the '$'
      prefix on the standard input arguments (`bizdoc`, `sender`, and `receiver`)
      when calling `$service`. When true `$service` should implement the
      `TundraTN/tundra.tn.schema:processor` specification, when false `$service`
      should implement the `WmTN/wm.tn.rec:ProcessingService` specification.
      Defaults to true.

    * `$part` is an optional name identifying the bizdoc content part to be
      parsed and added to the input pipeline of the call to `$service`. Defaults
      to the default content part (xmldata for XML documents, ffdata for Flat
      File documents). Not used if `$parse?` is false.

    * `$encoding` optional character encoding to be used when reading the bizdoc
      content part bytes. If not specified, defaults to the character set
      specified in the MIME content type of the content part being parsed, or
      failing that the Java virtual machine [default charset].

* #### tundra.tn:receive

  Receives arbitrary (XML or flat file) content and routes it
  to Trading Networks. The content can be specified as a string,
  byte array, java.io.InputStream, or org.w3c.dom.Node object.

  This service is either intended to be invoked directly by
  clients via HTTP or FTP, or it can be wrapped by another
  service which specifies appropriate TN_parms to control the
  routing of the content (ie. a one-line flat file gateway
  service).

  When invoked via HTTP, if the content is received successfully
  an HTTP 200 OK response is returned, with a 'text/plain'
  response body containing the resulting Trading Networks bizdoc
  internal ID. If a security exception is encountered, an HTTP
  403 Forbidden response is returned with a 'text/plain' response
  body containing the exception message. If any other type of
  exception is encountered, an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
  response is returned, with a 'text/plain' response body
  containing the exception message.

  When invoked via transports other than HTTP, for example FTP,
  if the content is received successfully the service invocation
  will succeed and a response body containing the resulting
  Trading Networks bizdoc internal ID is returned. If a security
  or any other exception is encountered, the service invocation
  will fail by rethrowing the exception.

  When invoked by a wrapping service, an exceptions encountered
  will be thrown to the calling service. It is then the calling
  service's responsibility to set an appropriate response for
  the transport in question.

  * Inputs:
    * `strict` is an optional boolean flag indicating whether 'strict'
      mode routing should be used for the received content. Defaults
      to true. To disable 'strict' mode when using HTTP, include

        'application/octet-stream'.

      * `$contentEncoding` is an optional character encoding used by
        the received content, for example 'UTF-16'. Defaults to the
        encoding specified as the charset property in the content
        type, or failing that defaults to 'UTF-8'.

      * `$contentName` is an optional logical label or name for the
        received content, typically the filename for flat files.
        For HTTP transports, defaults to the the filename specified
        in the Content-Disposition header, or failing that the
        filename part of the request URI. For non-HTTP transports,
        defaults to the filename returned by
        `WmPublic/pub.flow:getTransportInfo`.

      * `$contentSchema` is an optional Integration Server document
        reference or flat file schema the received content conforms
        to. Defaults to the value of the `$schema` variable, if
        specified in the pipeline.

      * `$user` is the user that sent the received content. Defaults
        to the currently logged on user.

      * `SenderID` is an optional Trading Networks profile external ID
        which identifies the sender of the content. For flat files
        only, defaults to the currently logged on user.

      * `ReceiverID` is an optional Trading Networks profile external ID
        which identifies the receiver of the content. For flat files
        only, defaults to the value of the HTTP header 'X-Recipient',
        or failing that the required External ID value of the My
        Enterprise profile.

      * `DocumentID` is an optional ID used to identify the content in
        Trading Networks. For flat files only, defaults to the value
        of the HTTP header 'Message-ID', or failing that an [UUID] is
        automatically generated.

      * `GroupID` is an optional ID used to identify the group this
        content belongs to in Trading Networks. For flat files only,
        defaults to the value of `TN_parms/DocumentID`.

  * Outputs:
    * `id` is the internal/native ID assigned by Trading Networks to
      the resulting bizdoc.

* #### tundra.tn:reject

  Receives arbitrary (XML or flat file) content and then rejects it
  by always returning an error to the client.

  This service is intended to be invoked by clients via HTTP or FTP.

* #### tundra.tn:reroute

    Reprocesses the given document in Trading Networks by rematching it against
    the processing rule base and executing the first processing rule that
    matches.

    * Inputs:
      * `bizdoc` is the Trading Networks document to be rerouted.

    * Outputs:
      * `bizdoc`
      * `sender`
      * `receiver`
      * `TN_parms`

* #### tundra.tn:retrieve

  Retrieves arbitrary content (XML, flat files, binary) from the given `$source`
  URI, and routes it to Trading Networks.

  Additional retrieval protocols can be implemented by creating a service named
  for the URI scheme in the folder `Tundra/tundra.content.retrieve`.  Services in
  this folder must implement the `Tundra/tundra.schema.content.retrieve:handler`
  specification.

  * Inputs:
    * `$source` is a URI identifying the location from which content is to be
      retrieved. Supports the following retrieval protocols / URI schemes:

      * `file:` routes each file matching the given `$source` URI to Trading
        Networks. The file component of the URI can include wildcards
        or globs (such as `*.txt` or `*.j?r`) for matching multiple files at once.

        The following example would process all `*.txt` files in the specified directory:

            file:////server:port/directory/*.txt

        To ensure each file processed is not locked or being written to by
        another process, the file is first moved to an archive directory prior
        to processing. The name of this directory can be configured by adding a
        query string parameter called `archive` to the URI, for example:

            file:////server:port/directory/*.txt?archive=backup

        In this example, files are first moved to a subdirectory named `backup`.
        If not specified, the archive directory defaults to a subdirectory named
        `archive`.

      a single execution. Defaults to 1000.

    * `$strict?` is an optional boolean, which if true will abort routing/
      processing rule execution of the document if any any errors (such as
      validation errors) are encountered prior to processing. Defaults to false.

    * `TN_parms` is an optional set of routing hints for Trading Networks to use
      when routing the retrieved content.

* #### tundra.tn:split

  One-to-many conversion of an XML or flat file Trading Networks document
  (bizdoc) to another format. Calls the given splitting service, passing the
  parsed content as an input, and routing the split content back to Trading
  Networks as new documents automatically.

  Supports 'strict' mode processing of bizdocs: if any `$strict` error classes
  are set to 'true' and the bizdoc contains errors for any of these classes,
  the bizdoc will not be processed; instead an exception will be thrown and
  handled by the `$catch` service. For example, if you have enabled duplicate
  document checking on the Trading Networks document type and do not wish to
  process duplicates, set the `$strict/Saving` error class to 'true' and
  duplicate documents will not be processed and will instead have their user
  status set to 'ABORTED' (when using the standard `$catch` service).

      reference or flat file schema to use to serialize the split documents
      returned by `$service`, if all the documents returned are of the same
      format. If the list of split documents contain dissimilar formats, then
      `$service` should return a list of Integration Server document reference
      or flat file schema names called `$schemas` of the same length as the
      split document list, and `$schema[n]` will be used to serialize
      `$documents[n]`.

    * `$service.input` is the optional name of the input parameter used for the

### Content

* #### tundra.tn.content:route

  Routes arbitrary content specified as a string, byte array, input
  stream, or IData document to Trading Networks.

  Correctly supports large documents, so any document considered
  large will be routed as a large document in TN, unlike the
  WmTN/wm.tn.doc.xml:routeXML service.

  Also supports overriding the normally recognised document attributes,
  such as sender, receiver, document ID, group ID, conversation ID,
  and document type with the value specified in TN_parms for both XML
  and flat files documents.

  * Inputs:
    * `$content` is string, byte array, input stream, or IData
      document content to be routed to Trading Networks.

    * `$content.type` is the MIME media type that describes the format of the
      given content. For [JSON] content, a recognized [JSON] MIME media type,
      such as "application/json", must be specified.

    * `$schema` is the fully-qualified name of the parsing schema to use when
      serializing `$content` when provided as an IData document to [XML] or Flat
      File content, and can have the following values:
      * For [XML] content, specify the fully-qualified name of the document
        reference that defines the [XML] format.
      * For Flat File content specify the fully-qualified name of the flat
        file schema that defines the Flat File format.

      Defaults to serializing `$content` when provided as an IData document to
      [XML], if neither `$content.type` nor `$schema` are specified.

    * `TN_parms` is an optional set of routing hints for Trading
      Networks to use when routing `$content`. If specified, the
      following values will overwrite the normal bizdoc recognised
      values, allowing for sender, receiver, document ID, group ID,
      conversation ID, and document type to be forced to have the
      specified value (even for XML document types):
      * `SenderID`
      * `ReceiverID`
      * `DocumentID`
      * `DoctypeID`
      * `DoctypeName`
      * `GroupID`
      * `ConversationID`

      routing/processing rule execution of the document if any
      any errors (such as validation errors) are encountered prior
      to processing, and result in an exception being thrown.
      Defaults to false.

  * Outputs:
    * `$bizdoc` is the resulting Trading Networks document that was
      routed.
    * `$sender` is the Trading Networks profile of the sender of the
      document.
    * `$receiver` is the Trading Networks profile of the receiver of
      the document.
    * `TN_parms` is the routing hints used to route the document in
      Trading Networks.

Bizdoc-related services:

* #### tundra.attribute.datetime.transformer:parse

  Trading Networks date attribute transformer which parses the given Trading
  Networks document attribute value or list of values with the given
  datetime pattern into [java.util.Date] object or list of objects.

  Since the built-in TN date attribute parsing only supports
  [java.text.SimpleDateFormat], versions prior to Java 7 are unable to parse
  [ISO8601] dates, times, and datetimes when they include a timezone offset.
  This service supports named patterns including [ISO8601] and custom
  [java.text.SimpleDateFormat] patterns.

  Supports a handful of well-known named patterns:

      Name           Pattern
      -------------  --------------------------------------------
      datetime       ISO8601/XML datetime
      datetime.jdbc  yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS
      date           ISO8601/XML date
      date.jdbc      yyyy-mm-dd
      time           ISO8601/XML time
      time.jdbc      HH:mm:ss
      milliseconds   Number of milliseconds since the Epoch,
                     January 1, 1970 00:00:00.000 GMT (Gregorian)

    * `$schema` is the name of the Integration Server document reference or flat
      file schema used to parse the content into an IData structure.

  * Outputs:
    * `$documents` is the split list of content with which each item of the
      list will be routed back to Trading Networks as individual new
      documents. This is the default name for this output parameter. The
      actual name of the parameter can be changed using the
      `TundraTN/tundra.tn:split` `$service.output` parameter, which allows the
      use of `TundraTN/tundra.tn:split` with existing mapping services.

    * `$schemas` is the list of Integration Server document references or flat
      file schemas that each `$documents` item conforms to. The length of
      `$schemas` must match the length of `$documents`, and `$schema[n]` is used to
      serialize `$document[n]` to an input stream for routing to Trading
      Networks.

    * `TN_parms` provides routing hints for Trading Networks. It can be
      specified as either a singleton IData or an IData list. If specified as
      a singleton, it will be used when routing every item in the `$documents`
      list. If specified as a list, the length of `TN_parms` must match the
      length of `$documents`, and `TN_parms[n]` will be used when routing
      `$documents[n]` to Trading Networks.

* #### tundra.tn.schema:translator

  Translation services used by `TundraTN/tundra.tn:translate` can implement this
  specification.

  * Inputs:
    * `$bizdoc` is the Trading Networks document whose content is to be
      translated.

    * `$sender` is the Trading Networks partner profile associated with the
      sender of the bizdoc.

    * `$receiver` is the Trading Networks partner profile associated with the
      receiver of the bizdoc.

    * `$document` is the parsed bizdoc content for translation. This is the
      default name for this input parameter. The actual name of the parameter
      can be changed using the `TundraTN/tundra.tn:translate` `$service.input`
      parameter, which allows the use of `TundraTN/tundra.tn:translate` with
      existing mapping services.

    * `$schema` is the name of the Integration Server document reference or flat
      file schema used to parse the content into an IData structure.

  * Outputs:
    * `$translation` is the translated content which will be routed back to
      Trading Networks as a new document. This is the default name for this
      output parameter. The actual name of the parameter can be changed using
      the `TundraTN/tundra.tn:translate` `$service.output` parameter, which
      allows the use of `TundraTN/tundra.tn:translate` with existing mapping
      services.

    * `TN_parms` is an optional set of routing hints used when routing the
      translated document to Trading Networks.
