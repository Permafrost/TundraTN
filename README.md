# TundraTN ‚ùÑ

A package of useful services for webMethods Trading Networks 7.1 or higher.

## Dependencies

TundraTN is dependent on the following packages:

* Tundra
* WmTN

## Installation

From your Integration Server installation:

```sh
$ cd ./packages
$ git clone https://github.com/Permafrost/TundraTN.git
$ git checkout v<n.n.n> # where <n.n.n> is the desired version
```

Then activate and enable the TundraTN package from the package management web page on the
Integration Server web administration site.

## Upgrading

From your Integration Server installation:

```sh
$ cd ./packages/TundraTN
$ git fetch
$ git checkout v<n.n.n> # where <n.n.n> is the desired version
```

Then reload the TundraTN package from the package management web page on the
Integration Server web administration site.

## Conventions

1. All input and output pipeline arguments are prefixed with '$' as a poor-man's
   scoping mechanism (typical user-space variables will be unprefixed), except
   Trading Networks-specific arguments, such as bizdoc, sender and receiver
2. All boolean arguments are suffixed with a '?'
3. Single-word argument names are preferred. Where multiple words are necessary, 
   words are separated with a '.'
4. Service namespace is kept flat. Namespace folders are usually nouns. Service 
   names are usually verbs, indicating the action performed on the noun (parent 
   folder)
5. All private elements are kept in the tundra.tn.support folder. All other 
   elements comprise the public API of the package. As the private 
   elements do not contribute to the public API, they are liable to change at 
   any time. Enter at your own risk

## Tests

*Almost* every service in TundraTN has unit tests, located in the 
tundra.tn.support.test folder.

To run the test suite, either:
* run tundra:test($package = "TundraTN") service directly
* visit <http://localhost:5555/invoke/tundra/test?$package=TundraTN>  
  (substitute your own Integration Server host and port for localhost:5555)

## Services

Top-level services for the most common tasks:

```java
// Delivers Trading Networks document (bizdoc) content to the given destination URI.
// 
// Supports the following delivery protocols / URI schemes:
//   - file: writes the given content to the file specified by the destination URI.  The
//           following additional options can be provided via the $pipeline document:
//           - $mode: append / write
//   - http: transmits the given content to the destination URI. The following adttional
//           options can be provided via the $pipeline document:
//           - $method: get / put / post / delete / head / trace / options
//           - $headers/*: additional HTTP headers as required
//           - $authority/user: the username to log on to the remote web server with
//           - $authority/password: the password to log on to the remote web server with
//   - https: refer to http
// 
// Variable substitution is performed on all variables specified in the $pipeline document,
// and the $destination URI, allowing for dynamic generation of any of these values. Also,
// if $service is specified, it will be called prior to variable substitution and thus can
// be used to populate the pipeline with variables to be used by the substitution.
// 
// This service leverages the Tundra service tundra.content:deliver. Therefore, additional 
// delivery protocols can be implemented by creating a service named for the URI scheme in 
// the Tundra package folder tundra.support.content.deliver.  Services in this folder should 
// implement the tundra.support.content.deliver:handler specification.
// 
// TODO: support the standard Trading Network profile delivery methods, such as primary HTTP
// etc.
tundra.tn:deliver(bizdoc, $destination, $encoding, $service, $catch, $finally, $pipeline, $part);

// Logs a message to the Trading Networks activity log.
tundra.tn:log($bizdoc, $type, $class, $summary, $message);

// Processes a Trading Networks document by parsing the given document content part, and calling 
// the given service with the following input arguments: $bizdoc, $sender and $receiver are the 
// normal bizdoc processing service inputs (except with the '$' prefix), $document is the parsed 
// content part as an IData document, and $schema is the name of the document reference or flat 
// file schema used by the parser.
// 
// As it provides logging, content parsing, error handling, and document status updates, the
// $service processing service does not need to include any of this common boilerplate code.
// 
// If a custom $catch service is specified, it will be called if an error occurs while processing
// the bizdoc.  The $catch service will be passed the current pipeline, along with the following 
// additional arguments: 
//   $exception - the actual exception object thrown by the $service
//   $exception.message - the error message
//   $exception.class - the exception object's Java class name 
//   $exception.stack - the Java call stack at the time the exception occurred
// 
// This service is designed to be called directly from a Trading Networks bizdoc processing rule,
// hence the non-dollar-prefixed bizdoc argument.
// 
// Additional arbitrary input arguments for $service (or pub.flatFile:convertToValues/
// pub.xml:xmlStringToXMLNode/pub.xml:xmlNodeToDocument via tundra.tn.document:parse) can be 
// specified in the $pipeline document. Fully qualified names will be handled correctly, for 
// example an argument named 'example/item[0]' will be converted to an IData document named 
// 'example' containing a String list named 'item' with it's first value set accordingly.
tundra.tn:process(bizdoc, $service, $catch, $finally, $pipeline, $part, $encoding);

// One-to-one conversion of an XML or flat file Trading Networks document (bizdoc) to another format. 
// Calls the given translation service, passing the parsed content as an input, and routing the 
// translated content back to Trading Networks as a new document automatically. 
// 
// The translation service must accept a single IData document and return a single IData document, 
// and optionally TN_parms.
tundra.tn:translate(bizdoc, $service, $catch, $finally, $pipeline, $schema.input, $schema.output, $service.input, $service.output, $part);
```

### Content

```java
// Routes arbitrary content specified as a string, byte array, input stream, or IData document 
// to Trading Networks. Correctly supports large documents, so any document considered large will 
// be routed as a large document to Trading Networks, unlike the WmTN/wm.tn.doc.xml:routeXML service.
tundra.tn.content:route($content, $schema, TN_parms);
```

### Document

Bizdoc-related services:

```java
// Trading Networks string transformer which returns whether the given Trading Networks document (bizdoc) 
// attribute value/s match the given regular expression pattern (arg).
//
// Refer to <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html> for more information
// on regular expression use in Java.
tundra.tn.document.attribute.string:match(values[], arg);

// Trading Networks string transformer which URI decodes the given Trading Networks document (bizdoc) 
// attribute value/s.
tundra.tn.document.attribute.uri:decode(values[]);

// Trading Networks string transformer which URI encodes the given Trading Networks document (bizdoc) 
// attribute value/s.
tundra.tn.document.attribute.uri:encode(values[]);

// Returns the document's content associated with the given part name as a stream. If the part
// name is not provided, the default content part is returned (xmldata for XML; ffdata for Flat 
// Files).
tundra.tn.document.content:get($bizdoc, $part, $encoding);

// Adds a content part with the given name and content, specified as a string, bytes or stream, 
// to the given Trading Networks document (bizdoc).
tundra.tn.document.content:add($bizdoc, $part, $content, $content.type);

// Derives a new bizdoc from an existing bizdoc, optionally updating the sender and/or 
// receiver on the derivative.
tundra.tn.document:derive($bizdoc, $sender, $receiver);

// Returns the document associated with the given internal ID, optionally 
// including the document's content parts.
tundra.tn.document:get($id, $content?);

// Parses the Trading Networks document content part associated with the given part
// name, or the default part if not provided, using the parsing schema configured on 
// the document type.
tundra.tn.document:parse($bizdoc, $part, $encoding);

// Relates two Trading Networks documents (bizdocs) together.
tundra.tn.document:relate($bizdoc.source, $bizdoc.target, $relationship);

// Returns the parsing schema associated with the given Trading Networks document.
tundra.tn.document.schema:get($bizdoc);

// Sets user status on the given Trading Networks document.
tundra.tn.document.status:set($bizdoc, $status);

// Returns the Trading Networks document type associated with the given ID as an 
// IData document.
// 
// Use this service in preference to WmTN/wm.tn.doctype:view, as the WmTN service 
// returns an object of type com.wm.app.tn.doc.BizDocType which, despite looking
// like one, is not a normal IData document and therefore causes problems in
// Flow services. For example, you cannot branch on fields in the faux document.
tundra.tn.document.type:get($id);

// Returns the parsing schema associated with the given Trading Networks document type.
tundra.tn.document.type.schema:get($type);
```

### Exception

Exception-related services:

```java
// Handles a Trading Networks document processing error by logging the error against
// the document in the activity log, and setting the user status to 'ERROR'.
tundra.tn.exception:handle($bizdoc);
```

### Profile

Partner profile-related services:

```java
// Returns the Trading Networks profile associated with the given ID. If $type is 
// null, then $id must be the internal partner ID, otherwise $type is the external
// ID name to use to find the profile.
tundra.tn.profile:get($id, $type);

// Returns the Trading Networks Enterprise partner profile.
tundra.tn.profile:self();
```
